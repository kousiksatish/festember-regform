1
00:00:05,616 --> 00:00:08,134
When you find that one person

2
00:00:08,136 --> 00:00:09,736
who connects you to the world,

3
00:00:09,738 --> 00:00:14,323
you become someone different.

4
00:00:14,325 --> 00:00:19,078
Someone better.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,932
When that person is
taken from you...

6
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:26,953
What do you become then?

7
00:00:33,827 --> 00:00:35,028
Whatever he wanna do, you know?

8
00:00:36,598 --> 00:00:39,465
What? Hmm?

9
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:41,434
Where'd you get that,
in a cereal box?

10
00:00:41,436 --> 00:00:43,186
Huh? You wanna see
a real gun?

11
00:00:44,938 --> 00:00:46,406
Forget you.

12
00:00:46,408 --> 00:00:48,307
Every little punk
is carrying now, Anton.

13
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:50,359
That's why your father wanted us
to take the car home.

14
00:00:50,361 --> 00:00:52,278
Relax.

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,447
We're picking up new hardware
next week.

16
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:57,116
Restore a little order.

17
00:00:57,118 --> 00:00:58,785
Besides, when we take the car,

18
00:00:58,787 --> 00:01:00,737
we don't get to meet
new friends.

19
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:02,071
Look at this guy.

20
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:19,222
You didn't bring enough
for the whole group.

21
00:01:19,224 --> 00:01:21,174
I have to teach you
about sharing.

22
00:01:27,815 --> 00:01:29,799
Aah!

23
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,133
I'll need a statement from the bum.
What hospital did they take him to?

24
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:07,453
He declined treatment.
We got video on it, though.

25
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:28,674
You know, you could have
done me a favor

26
00:02:28,676 --> 00:02:31,661
and let those guys land
a couple more punches.

27
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:34,196
Question for you.

28
00:02:34,198 --> 00:02:35,464
Looking at that tape,

29
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:38,417
I'd say you spent some time
in the service.

30
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:41,053
But you don't learn
how to fight like that

31
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:42,638
in the regular army.

32
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,807
So what were you,
special forces?

33
00:02:44,809 --> 00:02:47,643
Delta?

34
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,665
I'm Carter.
You didn't give us a name.

35
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:55,434
You know, it's funny.

36
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:58,321
Seems like the only time
you need a name now

37
00:02:58,323 --> 00:03:00,723
is when you're in trouble.

38
00:03:00,725 --> 00:03:02,825
So am I in trouble?

39
00:03:02,827 --> 00:03:05,411
I don't know, you tell me.

40
00:03:05,413 --> 00:03:07,446
You're the one
living on the street.

41
00:03:11,535 --> 00:03:15,254
Yeah, making that transition
back can be tough.

42
00:03:15,256 --> 00:03:18,174
Some guys I knew
got a little lost,

43
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:20,676
needed a little help adjusting.

44
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:24,113
You need some help?

45
00:03:29,186 --> 00:03:31,938
Of course,
some other guys I knew,

46
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,274
they'd done so many
evil things,

47
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:39,011
they felt like they needed
the punishment.

48
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:42,932
That sound more like
your story?

49
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:49,455
Excuse me for a second.

50
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:08,007
I'm here for my client.

51
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:09,308
Wow.

52
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,293
Wow, wow.

53
00:04:11,295 --> 00:04:12,478
Your guy's prints were found

54
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,730
in half a dozen crime scenes
over the years.

55
00:04:14,732 --> 00:04:17,266
Open warrants
in four different countries.

56
00:04:17,268 --> 00:04:19,852
Who you got down there, Carter,

57
00:04:19,854 --> 00:04:22,304
the angel of death?

58
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:25,691
I appreciate the help,
counselor.

59
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:29,445
But who's picking up...
The tab?

60
00:04:32,332 --> 00:04:34,133
Our employer wants
to have a word with you.

61
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:17,994
Do I owe you money?

62
00:05:17,996 --> 00:05:19,862
'Cause I'm, uh...

63
00:05:19,864 --> 00:05:22,131
Running a little short
at the moment.

64
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:25,167
You don't owe me anything,
Mr. Reese.

65
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:28,504
That's the name
you prefer, isn't it?

66
00:05:28,506 --> 00:05:31,507
I know you've had several.

67
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:35,261
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
tell anybody about you.

68
00:05:35,263 --> 00:05:39,265
You don't know anything
about me.

69
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:43,218
I know exactly everything
about you, Mr. Reese.

70
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,822
I know about the work you
used to do for the government.

71
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:48,357
I know about the doubts
you came to have

72
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:49,942
about that work.

73
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:51,610
I know that the government,
along with everybody else,

74
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:55,681
thinks you're dead.

75
00:05:55,683 --> 00:05:56,749
I know you've spent
the last couple of months

76
00:05:56,751 --> 00:06:00,786
trying to drink yourself
to death.

77
00:06:00,788 --> 00:06:03,589
I know you're contemplating
more efficient ways to do it.

78
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:08,094
So you see,
knowledge is not my problem.

79
00:06:08,096 --> 00:06:11,630
Doing something
with that knowledge...

80
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:16,085
That's where you'd come in.

81
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:21,690
And you can call me
Mr. Finch.

82
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:25,227
I think you and I can
help one another.

83
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:27,063
I don't think you need
a psychiatrist

84
00:06:27,065 --> 00:06:29,448
or a support group, or pills...

85
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,101
What do I need?

86
00:06:32,103 --> 00:06:35,821
You need a purpose.

87
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:39,125
More specifically,
you need a job.

88
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:48,384
Eight million people.

89
00:06:48,386 --> 00:06:49,685
You know what they all
have in common?

90
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:53,472
None of them knows
what happens next.

91
00:06:53,474 --> 00:06:57,860
Someone is murdered
in New York City every 18 hours.

92
00:06:57,862 --> 00:06:59,361
At the end of the day,

93
00:06:59,363 --> 00:07:01,180
one of these people
will be gone.

94
00:07:01,182 --> 00:07:04,466
Bad things happen
to people every day.

95
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:06,569
You can't stop that.

96
00:07:06,571 --> 00:07:08,320
What if you could?

97
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:10,790
Not the things that happen
in the heat of the moment.

98
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:13,409
But so many crimes are planned

99
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:16,762
days, weeks in advance.

100
00:07:16,764 --> 00:07:20,533
What if you could stop those?

101
00:07:20,535 --> 00:07:22,168
I've got a list.

102
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,787
A list of people who are
about to be involved

103
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:27,139
in very bad situations.

104
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:29,175
Murders, kidnappings.

105
00:07:29,177 --> 00:07:31,844
The people that are on my list,

106
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:33,429
they have no idea that
anything's about

107
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:34,513
to happen to them.

108
00:07:34,515 --> 00:07:37,383
Most of them are just
ordinary people

109
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:40,970
- like her.
- Thank you.

110
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:43,505
Her name is Diane Hansen,

111
00:07:43,507 --> 00:07:46,308
and this week she's
at the top of my list.

112
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,477
I don't know exactly
what's going to happen

113
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,529
or what her role in it is.

114
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:54,016
She might be the victim.
She could be the perpetrator.

115
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:56,485
All I know is that
she's involved.

116
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:57,686
I want you to follow her,

117
00:07:57,688 --> 00:07:59,238
figure out what's gonna
to happen,

118
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,790
and stop it from happening.

119
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,128
So what do you think?

120
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,667
I think you're
a bored rich guy.

121
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:13,869
I think that woman's
probably your ex-wife

122
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:15,838
or someone you rode
in an elevator with once.

123
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,023
And either way,
I think I'm done.

124
00:08:36,693 --> 00:08:39,278
Tonight police are looking
for a homeless man

125
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,696
for further questioning.

126
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:42,731
The unidentified man
was originally believed

127
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:44,700
to be the victim
of a violent assault

128
00:08:44,702 --> 00:08:45,918
on the subway.

129
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,737
But now police consider the man
a person of interest

130
00:08:48,739 --> 00:08:51,573
in a number of crimes
nationwide.

131
00:09:07,607 --> 00:09:10,259
Hey, sweetheart, what's wrong?

132
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:12,945
Jess, what's wrong?

133
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:31,830
You need to understand,
Mr. Reese,

134
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:33,615
the information I have
is incomplete,

135
00:09:33,617 --> 00:09:35,134
but it's never wrong.

136
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:37,002
You need to know
what it would be like

137
00:09:37,004 --> 00:09:39,672
to be forced to listen
to someone get murdered,

138
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:40,956
and not be able to
do anything about it.

139
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:09,451
One three eight

140
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:10,502
dot seven X-ray.

141
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:15,658
12 August, 2008.
1:37 A.M.

142
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,761
Too late.

143
00:10:18,763 --> 00:10:21,180
This recording
is three years old.

144
00:10:21,182 --> 00:10:26,185
A woman murdered in this room
by her husband.

145
00:10:26,187 --> 00:10:28,687
For the insurance.

146
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:31,223
You were too late for her.

147
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:33,475
Just like you were too late
for your friend Jessica.

148
00:10:33,477 --> 00:10:35,527
You were halfway
around the world

149
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:38,030
when she was killed.

150
00:10:38,032 --> 00:10:40,349
What the hell
do you know about it?

151
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:42,318
It's the truth.
You left the government

152
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
because they lied to you--
I never will.

153
00:10:44,322 --> 00:10:46,521
I think all you ever wanted
to do was protect people.

154
00:10:59,502 --> 00:11:02,421
It's a wire-tap recording.

155
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:08,477
NSA or FISA.
Government.

156
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:10,346
But you're not government.

157
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:12,481
No, I'm not.

158
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:24,543
I guess you could call me
a concerned third party.

159
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:28,397
You couldn't have saved
this woman...

160
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,249
Or your friend.

161
00:11:30,251 --> 00:11:32,734
But you could have
if you had have known in time.

162
00:11:32,736 --> 00:11:34,870
And that's the other thing
I'm offering you,

163
00:11:34,872 --> 00:11:37,289
a chance to be there in time.

164
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:44,713
It's not too late for her.

165
00:11:44,715 --> 00:11:46,765
You could help me stop
what's about to happen.

166
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:49,201
The question is, will you?

167
00:11:57,705 --> 00:12:01,261
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

168
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:10,335
What is this place?

169
00:12:10,337 --> 00:12:13,505
The decline
of Western civilization.

170
00:12:13,507 --> 00:12:16,341
The city closed
half its libraries.

171
00:12:16,343 --> 00:12:17,676
Budget cuts.

172
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:22,514
This building was sold
to a bank that I control,

173
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:25,100
which promptly declared
bankruptcy.

174
00:12:25,102 --> 00:12:27,802
So the property's in
a kind of limbo.

175
00:12:27,804 --> 00:12:29,855
It doesn't exist.

176
00:12:29,857 --> 00:12:33,275
Neither do you.
I did a little digging.

177
00:12:33,277 --> 00:12:36,411
I recognize, Mr. Reese,
that there's a disparity

178
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:38,497
between how much
I know about you

179
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:40,365
and how much you know about me.

180
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:42,367
I know you'll be trying
to close that gap

181
00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:44,002
as quickly as possible.

182
00:12:44,004 --> 00:12:50,208
But I should tell you
I'm a really private person.

183
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,628
Drivers licenses...
Credit cards.

184
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,815
Six cover identities.

185
00:12:56,817 --> 00:13:00,685
Funds to be replenished
through a proxy corporation.

186
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:04,439
Just like when you were
with the agency.

187
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:05,724
When I was with the agency

188
00:13:05,726 --> 00:13:09,327
I knew who was
picking up the tab.

189
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:11,646
This is your list?

190
00:13:11,648 --> 00:13:12,864
<i>The</i> list?

191
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:13,932
Yeah.

192
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:17,769
But you don't get names,
do you?

193
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:20,521
These are social security
numbers.

194
00:13:20,523 --> 00:13:25,827
And each of them map out
to a violent crime.

195
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:27,762
And all of these numbers
represent...

196
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:29,898
Lost chances.

197
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,366
I could be
a lot more help to you

198
00:13:31,368 --> 00:13:33,835
if you just tell me where
you're getting these numbers.

199
00:13:33,837 --> 00:13:35,253
It doesn't really matter
where I get the numbers.

200
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:37,038
What you need to know is that
the next number that's up

201
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,259
is hers.

202
00:13:45,264 --> 00:13:48,099
Diane Hansen.

203
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:51,152
Grew up in Detroit.

204
00:13:51,154 --> 00:13:53,271
Moved to the city
after law school.

205
00:13:53,273 --> 00:13:54,906
Single.

206
00:13:54,908 --> 00:13:57,158
- She have any enemies?
- One or two.

207
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,361
She's an assistant
district attorney.

208
00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:01,646
Best conviction record
in her department.

209
00:14:01,648 --> 00:14:04,416
We have no idea when this
bad thing might happen, huh?

210
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:07,669
Could be in a week.
Could be five minutes.

211
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:09,504
That's why we need to learn
as much as we can about her.

212
00:14:09,506 --> 00:14:12,357
How do you intend to begin?

213
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:14,042
The slow way.

214
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:15,176
Cultivate a relationship

215
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:18,413
to allow you to earn
the asset's trust.

216
00:14:18,415 --> 00:14:20,949
And the fast way?

217
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:25,020
First, you break
into their home

218
00:14:25,022 --> 00:14:27,672
and go through all their stuff.

219
00:14:30,526 --> 00:14:34,145
Email, financial records,
personal effects.

220
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:41,953
Then you hack
into their cell phone.

221
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:44,772
As long as it's charged
and has signal,

222
00:14:44,774 --> 00:14:47,542
you can use the GPS
to track them.

223
00:14:51,631 --> 00:14:53,632
You can use the microphone to
listen into their conversations

224
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:55,600
whether they're talking
on the phone or not.

225
00:14:55,602 --> 00:14:58,253
Hi, mom. I'm sorry
I haven't called you back...

226
00:14:58,255 --> 00:14:59,638
Third step--

227
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,473
You need picture.

228
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:03,441
A wireless camera,
and you can keep an eye on them

229
00:15:03,443 --> 00:15:04,676
from anywhere.

230
00:15:04,678 --> 00:15:08,563
I know you're worried.
I know. I'm fine.

231
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:10,198
It is a tough job,
but I can look after myself.

232
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,183
You know that.

233
00:15:12,185 --> 00:15:15,820
She's tough, but she's scared
about something.

234
00:15:15,822 --> 00:15:18,740
Given Hansen's job,
we've got hundreds of people

235
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:21,476
who could be holding a grudge.

236
00:15:21,478 --> 00:15:23,161
I cut the list to two.

237
00:15:23,163 --> 00:15:25,613
The first is Wheeler,
her co-counselor.

238
00:15:25,615 --> 00:15:28,033
They dated for a few months
last year.

239
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:30,151
She broke things off.

240
00:15:30,153 --> 00:15:32,653
You got time to talk?
Maybe I can buy you dinner.

241
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:34,255
I'm busy. Another time?

242
00:15:34,257 --> 00:15:36,291
Is something wrong?
I've been noticing lately--

243
00:15:36,293 --> 00:15:38,326
No, I'm fine, thank you.
Thanks.

244
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:40,095
And 40% of murders involve

245
00:15:40,097 --> 00:15:43,498
some kind of romantic
relationship.

246
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,166
Wheeler's divorced.
One kid.

247
00:15:45,168 --> 00:15:48,186
Partial custody, alimony.
Career stalled.

248
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:51,740
The second person I'm
looking into is Lawrence Pope.

249
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,192
The man Hansen
is currently prosecuting.

250
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:55,927
Pope's on trial
for killing his friends

251
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:57,462
in a drug deal gone bad.

252
00:15:57,464 --> 00:15:59,247
Stole $1/2 million in cash.

253
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:03,435
Pope's gang may be
targeting her for reprisal.

254
00:16:03,437 --> 00:16:05,920
When we got there,
the scene was colorful.

255
00:16:05,922 --> 00:16:07,322
Five dead.

256
00:16:07,324 --> 00:16:09,207
One of them had managed
to crawl ten feet to a phone

257
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:10,492
to dial 911.

258
00:16:10,494 --> 00:16:13,361
Detective Fusco,
when you interviewed Mr. Pope,

259
00:16:13,363 --> 00:16:15,029
what did he tell you
in his defense?

260
00:16:15,031 --> 00:16:17,198
He said that if he'd have
shot the poor bastard,

261
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,466
he would have shot him
in the head.

262
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:22,587
Quote, "same as I always do,"
unquote.

263
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:24,038
He said he wouldn't have
left him there half-dead,

264
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,423
blubbering for his girlfriend.

265
00:16:29,378 --> 00:16:32,063
No more questions, your honor.

266
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:37,685
Detective...

267
00:16:37,687 --> 00:16:39,821
You went a little off script
in your testimony.

268
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:42,023
You never told me about
that conversation,

269
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:43,724
and it could clear Pope's name.

270
00:16:43,726 --> 00:16:46,611
What's it matter?
We got the guy.

271
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:48,747
It matters because it's my job

272
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:49,864
to make absolutely sure

273
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:51,249
that the wrong people
don't go to jail.

274
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:52,567
Do you remember?

275
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:55,120
Excuse me, I thought
we were on the same team.

276
00:16:57,406 --> 00:16:59,924
Something's gone wrong
with her case.

277
00:17:02,744 --> 00:17:05,196
Hansen's on the move.

278
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:06,631
She's phoning county lockup,

279
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:11,136
arranging a meeting
with Pope...Alone.

280
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:13,254
Isn't my lawyer supposed
to be here for this?

281
00:17:13,256 --> 00:17:15,940
I can call him if you want,
but the reason I'm here is

282
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:17,859
I don't think
you murdered those people.

283
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:20,228
I think somebody else
was in the house

284
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,197
when that 911 call was made.

285
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:23,531
Somebody who told you
what was said,

286
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:26,734
which means you weren't there.

287
00:17:26,736 --> 00:17:27,919
Is it somebody
you're trying to protect?

288
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,822
You gonna help me?
Is that it?

289
00:17:30,824 --> 00:17:32,207
The person who knows
what happened that night

290
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:33,792
must be somebody
you care about.

291
00:17:33,794 --> 00:17:36,127
Is it your younger brother
Michael?

292
00:17:36,129 --> 00:17:38,946
Pope's got a brother.
It's in his case file.

293
00:17:38,948 --> 00:17:40,114
Got it.

294
00:17:40,116 --> 00:17:41,883
Did he see the real killers?

295
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:43,284
You should
leave this alone, lady.

296
00:17:43,286 --> 00:17:44,969
I can do the time.

297
00:17:44,971 --> 00:17:48,173
These people are evil,
killing when they want.

298
00:17:48,175 --> 00:17:49,557
And they're protected
from on high.

299
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:50,791
You keep asking questions,
they'll kill me

300
00:17:50,793 --> 00:17:52,510
and my brother,
and probably you too.

301
00:17:52,512 --> 00:17:54,929
Whoever these people are,
you can trust me.

302
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:59,517
We'll take care of you
and your brother.

303
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,070
If the killers are out there,
I'm gonna find them,

304
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:03,304
whether you help me or not.

305
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:05,023
It's my job.
Now, why don't you--

306
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:07,909
Bitch, you keep
your damn mouth shut,

307
00:18:07,911 --> 00:18:09,944
or I'll shut it for you!

308
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,251
I'm fine.

309
00:18:16,253 --> 00:18:17,919
Okay. She's okay.
She's okay.

310
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:19,787
Finch, you were right
about Hansen.

311
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:22,257
Whoever framed Pope
will be coming after her,

312
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:25,710
and only Pope's brother Michael
knows who they are.

313
00:18:35,084 --> 00:18:37,300
Hi, mom, it's Jessica.

314
00:18:37,302 --> 00:18:39,503
I'm just down in Mexico
with Cindy,

315
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:42,005
and I'll be back tomorrow.
Okay?

316
00:18:42,007 --> 00:18:43,590
- Talk soon. Bye.
- Cindy?

317
00:18:43,592 --> 00:18:44,874
Yeah.

318
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:47,144
- I look like a Cindy?
- Yeah.

319
00:18:47,146 --> 00:18:50,213
I didn't tell her about us yet.

320
00:18:50,215 --> 00:18:53,517
It's been six months.

321
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:59,823
I wish this weekend

It already has.
It's Tuesday.

323
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:06,563
Yes, which means that you
have to go back to the base,

324
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:09,866
and I'm not gonna see you again
for two weeks, which I hate.

325
00:19:09,868 --> 00:19:13,670
Then ask me to stay,
and I will.

326
00:19:13,672 --> 00:19:17,524
I'll quit.
I'll quit.

327

- What?
- Yeah.

330
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:30,020
I didn't want
to take the chance

331
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:34,558
that you wouldn't be here
when I got back.

332

this morning.

340

Is it a plane crash?

341
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:08,124

You went to see Pope
last night?

Yeah. I gave him
one more chance

cut a deal.

She's trying to track down
Pope's brother Michael.

350
00:20:36,488 --> 00:20:38,839
He can ID the real killers.

351
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:41,291
And she's stonewalling Wheeler.

352
00:20:41,293 --> 00:20:42,976
What, does she think
he's involved?

353
00:20:42,978 --> 00:20:46,429
Remember, Pope said they were
protected from on high.

354
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:55,388
Wait a second.

355
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,357
Turns out there's a good reason
she doesn't trust Wheeler.

356
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,076
He might be working
with the killers.

357
00:21:00,078 --> 00:21:03,113
And they're after Michael Pope.

from your brother.

You see, Mr. Reese,
until that day,

00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:37,710
I had spent the better part of
my life making myself very rich.

453
00:26:37,712 --> 00:26:42,047
Suddenly all that money
didn't seem to amount to much.

454
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:43,399
After the attacks,

455
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:47,086
the government gave itself
the power to read every email,

456
00:26:47,088 --> 00:26:49,888
listen to every cell phone,

457
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,925
but they needed something
that could sort through it all,

458
00:26:52,927 --> 00:26:54,727
something that could
pick the terrorists

459
00:26:54,729 --> 00:26:57,546
out of the general population
before they could act.

460
00:26:57,548 --> 00:26:59,648
The public wanted
to be protected.

461
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:03,135
They just didn't want to know
how they were being protected.

462
00:27:03,137 --> 00:27:06,054
So when they finally
got a system that worked,

463
00:27:06,056 --> 00:27:08,107
they kept it secret.

464
00:27:08,109 --> 00:27:10,526
So how do you know about it?

465
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,912
I built it.

466
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:20,586
But there was a problem
with this machine.

467
00:27:20,588 --> 00:27:23,706
I had built it
to prevent the next 9/11.

468
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:27,626
But it was seeing
all sorts of crimes.

469
00:27:27,628 --> 00:27:30,679
So I had to teach the machine

470
00:27:30,681 --> 00:27:33,415
to divide the things it saw
into two lists:

471
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:37,102
Relevant and irrelevant.

472
00:27:37,104 --> 00:27:40,556
Events that would cause massive
loss of life were relevant,

473
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,526
so those would be passed along
to the NSA or the FBI.

474
00:27:44,528 --> 00:27:47,112
And the irrelevant information?

475
00:27:48,698 --> 00:27:53,736
Every night at midnight,
the machine erases it.

476
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:57,656
It was only later
that I realized my mistake.

477
00:27:57,658 --> 00:28:02,928
That irrelevant list
was eating away at me.

478
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,581
So where's the machine now?

479
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:07,583
What, the drives?
Who knows?

480
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,952
Government facility somewhere.

481
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,920
But the machine?

482
00:28:11,922 --> 00:28:16,842
The machine is everywhere.

483
00:28:16,844 --> 00:28:19,995
Watching us with 10,000 eyes.

484
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:24,266
Listening with a million ears.

485
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:26,652
What did I tell you
about sending email?

486
00:28:26,654 --> 00:28:27,936
Three weeks,
you could practically move in.

487
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:31,640
Never put anything in an email
you cannot own.

488
00:28:31,642 --> 00:28:33,575
You gave yourself a way
to communicate with it?

489
00:28:33,577 --> 00:28:37,529
I was building the government
a tool of unimaginable power.

490
00:28:37,531 --> 00:28:41,333
I thought maybe an off switch
would come in handy.

491
00:28:41,335 --> 00:28:44,453
So I built myself
a back door into it.

492

To access the irrelevant list.

493
00:28:45,873 --> 00:28:49,541
Just a social security number.

494
00:28:49,543 --> 00:28:51,993
If anyone ever found out,
I'd lose access so...

495
00:28:51,995 --> 00:28:54,162
Nine digits, that's all we get.

496
00:28:54,164 --> 00:28:57,099
And we have no idea
why it picked Diane Hansen.

497
00:28:57,101 --> 00:28:58,500
It wouldn't be steering us
toward her

00:38:47,123 --> 00:38:49,106
you're telling us you couldn't
see what was happening

648
00:38:49,108 --> 00:38:51,826
in the parking lot at all.

649
00:38:51,828 --> 00:38:54,295
I'm done, your honor.

650
00:38:54,297 --> 00:38:56,247
Ms. Hansen?

651
00:38:56,249 --> 00:38:59,884
The state isn't paying you
by the hour, counselor.

652
00:38:59,886 --> 00:39:02,337
Why don't we have
the defendant tell you

653
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:03,454
in her own words?

654
00:39:03,456 --> 00:39:06,574
Let's listen
to the 911 call she made.

655
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:10,228
And hey,

656
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,729
take care of Wheeler.
Tonight.

657
00:39:11,731 --> 00:39:13,898
Make it look clean.
And Stills?

658
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,934
You screw this up,
I won't let it get to me.

659
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:18,970
I'll take care of you
just like I took care of Pope.

660
00:39:18,972 --> 00:39:20,188
I can look after myself.

661
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,990
You know that.

662
00:39:25,078 --> 00:39:33,201
♪ ♪

663
00:39:44,464 --> 00:39:46,998
You ready to get to work,
officer?

664
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,767
I'm no good to you.

665
00:39:49,769 --> 00:39:51,019
I'm dead.

666
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:53,471
Just a matter of time
before the gangs get me.

667
00:39:53,473 --> 00:39:55,023
Or I.A.

668
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:57,225
No one knows you're involved.

669
00:39:57,227 --> 00:39:58,509
I took care of that.

670
00:39:58,511 --> 00:40:01,529
Besides, they'll be too busy
looking for Stills.

671
00:40:01,531 --> 00:40:04,482
The police will think
he's run for it.

672
00:40:04,484 --> 00:40:07,018
The gangs and the mob will think
he's gone Witness Protection.

673
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,203
Is that where he is,
Witness Protection?

674
00:40:09,205 --> 00:40:10,872
No, Lionel.

675
00:40:10,874 --> 00:40:12,824
He's in the trunk.

676
00:40:12,826 --> 00:40:17,128
Only problem is, uh...
Um...

677
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,330
I had to shoot him
with your gun.

678
00:40:19,332 --> 00:40:22,083
And you'd have a hard time
explaining that one, so...

679
00:40:23,086 --> 00:40:24,702
You'll be taking another trip.

680
00:40:24,704 --> 00:40:27,922
And I'm not coming along
this time.

681
00:40:31,376 --> 00:40:33,377
Where am I going?

682
00:40:33,379 --> 00:40:34,846
Oyster bay.

683
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:39,434
Where no one's gonna find him
for a long, long time.

684
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:41,402
I'll be in touch.

685
00:40:57,369 --> 00:41:01,072
You have a decision to make.

686
00:41:01,074 --> 00:41:04,509
The machine gave you
another number.

687
00:41:04,511 --> 00:41:07,095
The numbers never stop coming.

688
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,580
You should know that up front.

689
00:41:09,582 --> 00:41:11,683
Why me?

690
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:17,105
I've been watching you
for a long time, John.

691
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:19,023
We have more in common
than you might think.

692
00:41:19,025 --> 00:41:23,260
The world thinks
we're both dead, for starters.

693
00:41:27,733 --> 00:41:31,536
You programmed the machine to
delete those irrelevant numbers.

694
00:41:31,538 --> 00:41:33,905
Now you're trying to save them.

695
00:41:33,907 --> 00:41:35,707
What changed your mind?

696
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:37,792
Let's just say you're not
the only one

697
00:41:37,794 --> 00:41:38,876
that's lost someone.

698
00:41:38,878 --> 00:41:42,780
If you wanna leave,

699
00:41:42,782 --> 00:41:45,917
I'll give you enough money
to get as far as you need.

700
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:48,119
Disappear.

701
00:41:49,638 --> 00:41:50,972
And if I stay?

702
00:41:50,974 --> 00:41:56,227
Sooner or later both of us'll
probably wind up dead.

703
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:59,897
Actually dead this time.

704
00:42:03,852 --> 00:42:07,855
I said I'd tell you the truth.

705
00:42:07,857 --> 00:42:10,108
Didn't say you'd like it.

706
00:42:17,649 --> 00:42:19,167
Start talking, officer.

707
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:20,418
You think I'm gonna rat
on my friends?

708
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,669
Please.

709
00:42:21,671 --> 00:42:23,638
You can tell the d.A.
All about your crooked pals.

710
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,290
I wanna know about him.
The guy who came after you.

711
00:42:26,292 --> 00:42:27,291
I don't know anything.

712
00:42:27,293 --> 00:42:29,660
It was just some guy alone
in a suit.

713
00:42:29,662 --> 00:42:30,878
Yeah, well,
you're gonna tell me

714
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,513
everything that
you don't know about him

715
00:42:32,515 --> 00:42:34,849
and where I can find him.
